ABSTRACT We present DivExplorer, a tool that enables users to explore datasets and find subgroups of data for which a classifier behaves in an anomalous manner. These subgroups, denoted as divergent subgroups, may exhibit, for example, higher-than-normal false positive or negative rates. DivExplorer can be used to analyze and debug classifiers. If the data has ethical or social implications, DivExplorer can be also used to identify bias in classifiers.

While these measures are typically estimated over all the data in a dataset, major differences in performance may occur across different data subgroups. Hence, the identification of these subgroups may be exploited for a variety of model evaluation tasks, ranging from model validation and error analysis, to model debugging. Furthermore, difference in performance may occur for sensitive attributes. In this case, machine learning models may inherit societal bias from unfair or underrepresented data. The notion of divergence [10] allows us to estimate the difference in classification performance measures, such as false positive rate, on a subgroup with respect to the entire dataset. In this paper we introduce DivExplorer, an interactive visual analytics tool to automatically identify and inspect data subgroups in which a model performs differently. Divergence exploration may reveal data subgroups in which a model performs poorly, thus helping data scientists both in model quality evaluation, and in (unsupervised) model audit for algorithmic bias. Our approach is model agnostic. This work is licensed under the Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0 International License.

Wemeasure divergence both for (a) data subgroups, and (b) individual (attribute, value) pairs. In the paper, we denote a single (attribute, value) pair as item, and a subgroup, i.e., a subset of the data characterized by a set of attributes values, as pattern or itemset. When analyzing divergence for a data subgroup, DivExplorer allows drilling down into the individual contribution of each item to the subgroup divergence, thus measuring its local divergence. The value of global item divergence, instead, is computed by considering the item contribution to all itemsets to which it belongs. This exploration also allows highlighting peculiar phenomena, the most interesting of which is the notion of corrective item, which is an item that decreases divergence when added to patterns. Previous approaches to subgroup analysis include both supervised and unsupervised approaches. Several interactive visualization tools [1, 8] audit model performance over data subsets relying on user expertise to identify the subgroups of interest. Differently, DivExplorerleveragesonanautomaticsubgroupdetectiontoidentify critical subgroups. Several interactive techniques that automatically identify interesting data subgroups have been recently proposed [3–7, 12]. Some approaches propose automated exploration and analysis in Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems to identify interesting data slices [7, 12]. Differently, DivExplorer integrates frequent pattern mining techniques to discover subgroups in which a classification model shows a dissimilar behavior. The visual analytics system FairVIS [4] exploits a clustering techniques to identify subgroups. The generated groups are then described by a few dominant features via feature entropy. Differently from FairVIS, DivExplorer slices the data by attribute domains. Hence, the characterizing features are known and easily interpretable. We further describe subgroups by quantifying the role of each attribute value to subgroup divergence using concepts of coalition game theory. The interactive system MithraCoverage [3, 6] focuses on investigating population bias in intersectional groups. The notion of uncovered pattern is introduced to identify intersectional subgroups with inadequate representation in the dataset. Differently, in our work,onlysubgroupswithadequaterepresentation are selected by a frequency threshold. Slice Finder [5] automatically identifies data slices in which the model performs poorly. It uses a top-down approach to find the top-k “problematic” slices. However, since its data exploration is stopped by a heuristic criterion, it may miss some relevant problematic subgroups. Slice Finder provides interactive visualizationsto inspect identified subgroups and interactively adjust input parameters to refine the exploration. Differently, DivExplorer exhaustively identifies all divergent subgroups that are sufficiently represented in the dataset, selected by a frequency threshold. Our tool allows users to interactively inspect subgroups via multiple views to fully characterize the divergent behavior, which include the contribution of each attribute value to subgroup divergence and its visual exploration through its lattice graph. An in depth comparison between our approach and Slice Finder is provided in [10]. Finally, DivExplorer estimates the global contribution to divergence of each attribute value over the entire dataset. 2 THEDIVEXPLORERSYSTEM DivExplorer [9] enables users to analyze the behavior of a classifier over a dataset, and to identify the portions of the dataset on which the classifier behaves in anomalous fashion, for example, by exhibiting particularly high false-positive or false-negative rates. If the underlying data has ethical implications, as in the running example we will consider, DivExplorer can be used to identify subgroups ofdataforwhichthebehavioroftheclassifieris problematic, and to analyze the factors that contribute to the problematic performance. 2.1 Background DivExplorer analyzes datasets in tabular form. Rows represent dataset instances, and columns are the attributes. DivExplorer assumes that continuous attributes are discretized. Hence, attributes that are continuous in nature, such as age, or income, need to be discretized into fixed ranges prior to the dataset being input to DivExplorer. However, the classifier itself can use the original, non-discretized data to build its model. Discretization is used only for data exploration, not for classification. We are considering, as future work, to integrate the discretization step directly in DivExplorer. Finally, DivExplorer requires users to identify two columns: the true class of each instance, and the predicted class of each instance as output by the classifier. Anitem is a pair attribute=value, such as age=25-45 (where 25-45 is the discretized range). An itemset is a set of items, such as {age=2545, race=Afr-Am}. The items in an itemset always involve different attributes. The support set of an itemset consists in the instances that satisfy it, and the support is the fraction of the dataset that satisfies it. DivExplorer analyzes the behavior of the classifier on all itemsets whose support is above a specified support threshold 𝑠. Specifying a support threshold has two related purposes: it excludes from analysis itemsets with few instances, on which the analysis would be affected by statistical fluctuations, and it reduces the number of itemsets under consideration, leading to a tool output of manageable size. 2.2 Implementation DivExplorer is implemented as a web app, and it can be deployed on any cloud that provides services for running containerized web services. Our hosting relies on Google Appengine. The back-end, which implements the data access layers and analysis algorithms, is written in Python, and relies on the DivExplorer package, where the algorithms are implemented [9]. The dataset analysis operations are implemented on top of the Pandas library for dataset processing [14], and the scikit-learn library for data mining [11]. The front-end is written using the vue.js Javascript framework, which enables dynamic visualizations and explorations of the dataset. Data is stored in a cloud SQL database. In particular, we use Google Cloud Mysql and Google Cloud Storage. 3 ATOUROFDIVEXPLORER The demo highlights DivExplorer interactive features that allow users to dynamically explore the behavior of a classifier on an arbitrary dataset. We illustrate the flow of the demonstration by using as a concrete example the COMPAS dataset [2]. COMPAS contains demographic information and criminal history of defendants. For each defendant, the dataset provides a score (called the COMPAS score), produced by a classifier, and intended to reflect the likelyhood that the defendant will commit crimes in the future (recidivate); the dataset also contains ground truth information on which defendants actually recidivated. The attributes of the COMPAS dataset include defendant age, gender, and race; number of prior crimes, whether the crimes were felonies or misdemeanors, and the length of prior stays in jail, among others. In the demo, we show how DivExplorer first provides global information, such asthelist ofitemsets wheretheclassifierbehavior mostdeviates from the average (see Section 3.1). Next, we show that users can drill into specific regions of data — specific itemsets, and explore the roles of individual attributes in affecting the classifier behavior, both considering specific itemsets (see Section 3.2) and on a global scale over the dataset (see Section 3.3). Before analyzing a dataset with the DivExplorer system, the dataset is uploaded and the two attributes (columns) corresponding to the predicted class and the ground-truth class are identified. The user can also select the columns to be analyzed. The only parameter to be configured is the support threshold. In our running example, we set it to 0.05: thus, only itemsets supported by 5% or more of the dataset instances are considered. The algorithms at the core of DivExplorer enable the efficient extraction and analysis of very large collections of itemsets. Hence, much lower supports can be chosen; see [10] for a discussion. 3.1 Divergent Itemsets DivExplorer analyzes the dataset and computes the divergence of itemsets with respect to error metrics such as false-positive, false-negative, and error rates. The false-positive divergence of an itemset is the difference between the false-positive rate as measured on the support set of the itemset, and as measured on the whole dataset. False-negative divergence and error divergence are similarly defined. DivExplorer computes the divergences for all itemsets above the specified support size, and displays them in a table that can be sorted according to any characteristics, as depicted in Figure 1. The 𝑡-value indicates the Welch statistical significance of the divergence. In Figure 1, the itemsets are sorted with respect to false-positive rate divergence. The itemset that has greatest divergence is {age=2545, #prior>3, race=Afr-Am, sex=Male}, with support 0.13 (or 13% of the dataset), and false-positive divergence 0.220. This indicates thatFigure 1: DivExplorer main UI. Table 1: Top-5divergentitemsetswiththeredundancypruning for FPR. COMPAS dataset,𝜖=0.02,𝑠=0.05.

Sorting the itemsets according to their false-negative rate divergence (FNR) would reveal that the most divergent itemset is {age>45, stay<week, #prior=[1,3]}. These defendants have a false negative rate 28% lower than the average defendant. Manyofthe most divergent itemsets in Figure 1 are quite similar. To obtain a more insightful summarization, DivExplorer enables users to prune (redundant) itemsets by specifying a threshold 𝜖. If two itemsets 𝐼 and 𝐼 ∪ {𝐴} have divergences closer than 𝜖, only the smaller itemset 𝐼 is included in the output. The top 5 itemsets for FPR-divergence, summarizing with 𝜖 = 0.02, are shown in Table 1. The total number of patterns is reduced from 313 to 51. 3.2 Measuring the Role of Items in Itemset Divergence On DivExplorer divergence table, the users can select the individual divergence values for detailed inspection. In Figure 1, the user has selected Δ𝐹𝑃𝑅 for the top itemset {age=25-45, #prior>3, race=Afr-Am, sex=Male}. Thus, the details for the FPR-divergence for this itemset are displayed at the bottom. On the bottom left is a bar graph indicating the extent to which the individual items contributed to the divergence of the itemset. The analysis is based on the notion of Shapley values [13]. TheFigure 2: Lattice showing a corrective phenomenon for FPR divergence on the COMPAS dataset (rhombus nodes). items are considered as players in a game, and the Shapley value is used to attribute to the items the overall divergence of the itemset (we refer to [10] for the details). Most of the divergence of this itemset (most of the excess FPR ) is due to having more than 3 prior offenses, with race=Afr-Am as the second most important factor. On the bottom right, similar information is conveyed via the lattice of subsets of the selected itemset. Each subset is labeled with its own divergence, and by hovering on it, the user can see which of the itemset’s items appear in the subset. The lattice view is particularly useful when items are correlated. In this case, the Shapley value splits the contribution among correlated items. The itemset lattice shows the precise effect of each item in each context. The lattice visualization is also useful for studying the role of corrective items, which are items that, when added to an itemset, reduce the divergence. For instance, Figure 2 shows that adding the age>45 item to the {#prior>3, sex=Male} itemset reduces the false-negative divergence from 0.13 to 0.003. This indicates that the bias corresponding to {#prior>3, sex=Male}, upon closer inspection, affects only people below 45. 3.3 ItemInfluence on the Entire Dataset The DivExplorer system also enables users to examine the influence of each item on the divergence of the entire dataset. This can be done in two different ways, both illustrated in Figure 3. The simplest measure, named the individual divergence of an item, is simply the divergence of an item in isolation. The global divergence of an item is a generalization of the Shapley value to the entire set of all items. We provide in [10] a precise mathematical definition. Intuitively, the global divergence summarizes how much an item increases the divergence when added to any itemset with which it is compatible (i.e., with which it does not share any attribute). The individual divergence is a simple and intuitive measure, but considers only items in isolation. The global divergence captures the role of an item in giving rise to divergence jointly with other attributes. From Figure 3, we see that the top item for global falsepositive divergence, #prior>3, is part of the itemset that has overall greatest divergence. Interestingly, this is not so for the next two items, age<25 and stay>3Months. To examine more closely their role, the user can use the search function in DivExplorer and examine the itemsets in which these items appear.
